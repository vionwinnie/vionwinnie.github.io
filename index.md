Hi all, I am Winnie. I am a data scientist and I really enjoy solving problem and create deployment solutions as a result. After my liberal arts education, I began to code on the job consulting different github repos and online resources. I would like to showcase my projects here and to motivate fellow aspiring data scientists. It's never too late to start learning, researching, and coding!
