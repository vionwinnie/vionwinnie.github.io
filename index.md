Hi every one, I am Winnie. I am a data scientist and I really enjoy solving problem and create deployment solutions as a result. I began coding after starting my investment career. I would like to showcase my projects here and to motivate fellow aspiring data scientists. It's never to late to start learning, researching, and coding! 

### Education
I grew up from Hong Kong, attended United World College in Hong Kong and then studied at Middlebury College in Vermont, USA on full scholarship. I majored in Middle Eastern history and minor in Mathematics and Arabic. After working at Fidleity Investments under the equity research department for 2.5 years, I went back to grad school and obtained my Masters in Analytics at Georgia Tech. 

### Topics in Data Science on my radar:
Natural Language Processing (BERT), Anomaly detection, Feature Engineering, AWS deployment, Visualization, Computer Vision

### Hobbies
In my free time, I enjoy playing table tennis, reading, biodynamic wine, photography, and traveling.
